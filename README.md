# GPT as a Better Programmer than me

Paul Chu was here.

Welcome to the GitHub repository for our tech talk on utilizing GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) as a pair programming tool. This repository contains resources, examples, and guides on how to effectively integrate GPT into your programming workflow to enhance productivity, creativity, and efficiency.

## Disclaimer
The following (not this text) was generated by GPT4 as an example. It does not necessarily represent how the current repository will behave or perform.

## Overview

Pair programming has long been recognized as a valuable practice in software development, involving two programmers working together at one workstation. One, the "driver," writes code while the other, the "navigator," reviews each line of code as it is typed. The roles switch frequently, promoting collaborative problem solving and code quality.

With the advent of advanced AI technologies, integrating GPT as a virtual partner in pair programming presents an innovative approach to software development. This talk explores the potential of GPT in assisting with code generation, debugging, and even architectural design discussions.

## Getting Started

Before diving into GPT-assisted pair programming, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Basic understanding of AI and machine learning concepts.
- Familiarity with programming languages and development environments.
- Access to GPT or GPT-based tools and APIs (e.g., OpenAI's GPT-3).

## Repository Structure

- `/docs` - Contains presentation slides and additional reading materials.
- `/examples` - Sample code and projects demonstrating GPT-assisted programming.
- `/guides` - Step-by-step guides on setting up and using GPT for programming tasks.
